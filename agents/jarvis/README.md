# Jarvis — phases 1–3

A standalone Chief-of-Staff agent system: a local daemon that schedules specialist
agents, collects evidence-backed signals, and serves **its own dashboard**. See
[docs/JARVIS-BLUEPRINT.md](../../docs/JARVIS-BLUEPRINT.md).

- **Phase 1** — orchestration: scheduler, signal bus, memory, budget governor, CLI.
- **Phase 2** — the first agent: `macro` (market research & news), plus brief composition.
- **Phase 3** — the dashboard, served by the daemon at `http://127.0.0.1:7777`.

`momentum`, `options` and `errands` are not registered yet. Their scheduled rules fire,
record `skipped — no handler registered`, and say so in `health` and on the dashboard.
A daemon that pretended otherwise would be worse than one reporting the gap.

Jarvis is self-contained and is not part of any other application. It reads market data
over HTTP from a market API (configurable — see *Data source* below) and stores
everything else itself.

## The dashboard

```bash
npm run jarvis:dashboard      # dashboard only, on http://127.0.0.1:7777
npm run jarvis:daemon         # agents + dashboard together
```

It shows what is above routine right now, the latest brief, per-agent health, today's
token budget, anything awaiting your approval, and the full signal stream — every signal
expanding to the evidence behind it.

Bound to `127.0.0.1`, with the `Host` header checked on every request, so it is not
reachable from the network and a page you visit elsewhere cannot address it. Because the
page and the daemon share an origin, **Approve and Dismiss work in the browser**:
approving records your decision and prints the order ticket for you to place. It never
transmits an order — the options agent has no order tool in its allowlist at all.

## Try it

```bash
npm run jarvis -- schedule          # upcoming fire times, IST
npm run jarvis -- health            # budget, agent status, today's signal counts
npm run jarvis -- signals --evidence --body
npm run jarvis -- tick              # run one scheduler tick right now
npm run jarvis -- serve             # dashboard without the agent loop
```

Run the market research agent now, off-schedule:

```bash
npm run jarvis -- run macro research_brief
```

Each run produces **one research brief**: a snapshot of Brent, gold, the S&P 500,
Nasdaq, Nikkei, KOSPI, Nifty, Bank Nifty, India VIX, USD/INR and the US 10Y; the news
turned into stories (the same event from ten outlets is one story, "10×"), grouped by
topic with new stories marked; and Claude's read of what it means for Indian markets,
with every point citing the stories it rests on and any figure not found in the source
data flagged.

The analysis runs on **your Claude subscription** through the Claude Code command-line
tool: no API key and no per-call charge, though it counts toward your plan's usage
limits. Log in once:

```bash
claude auth login
```

The call is locked down: no built-in tools, no MCP connectors (your Kite connector can
place orders; it is not reachable from here), your settings and hooks ignored, and an
empty working directory. It can only return JSON. Any `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the
environment is removed before the call, so it can never bill an API key by accident.
Set `JARVIS_CLAUDE_MODEL=opus` to pin a model; unset uses your plan's default.

Logged out, out of usage, or not installed, the brief still publishes prices and news
and says why the analysis is off.
A price move of 1.5σ or more that lines up with wide coverage raises the brief's
severity; it no longer decides whether you hear the news at all.

### Momentum agent

```bash
npm run jarvis -- run momentum momentum_brief
```

Runs every weekday at 18:45 IST, after NSE publishes delivery data. Ranks all Nifty 500
stocks on a 0–100 blend of 6-month (35%), 3-month (25%) and 1-year (20%) returns and
3-month strength vs the Nifty (20%), each as a percentile — continuous, so stocks don't
tie the way the screener's capped score does. The brief shows the leaders (liquid, above
the 200-day average, within 15% of the 52-week high), today's breakouts on volume, new
highs, golden crosses and delivery surges, which industries the leaders come from, what
entered or left the top 25 since the last run, and where each stock on **your watchlist**
stands. Watchlist stocks outside the Nifty 500 are measured from their own price history
and placed on the same scale (shown as ≈#rank). No model call: it costs nothing and
cannot invent anything.

The watchlist was seeded from your Kite holdings on 2026-10-09 (symbols only — no
quantities, prices or P&L). Add or remove stocks on the dashboard.

### Data source

Agents read quotes, charts and news from `JARVIS_MARKET_BASE` (default
`https://tickervane.vercel.app`). It is a backend detail behind one module,
[market.mjs](market.mjs) — nothing in the Jarvis UI refers to it, and swapping in a
direct feed or a broker API is a single file.

```bash
JARVIS_MARKET_BASE=http://localhost:5177 npm run jarvis -- run macro research_brief
```

Emit a signal by hand to see the envelope rules bite:

```bash
# accepted
npm run jarvis -- emit '{"agent":"macro","kind":"observation","severity":"elevated",
  "title":"Brent +3.8% on Hormuz reports",
  "subjects":[{"type":"instrument","ref":"BZ=F"}],
  "evidence":[{"source":"Yahoo Finance","value":87.3}]}'

# rejected — no evidence
npm run jarvis -- emit '{"agent":"macro","kind":"observation","title":"Feels bullish","evidence":[]}'
```

## Install as a background service

```bash
cp agents/jarvis/in.alphanova.jarvis.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/in.alphanova.jarvis.plist
```

Installed on this Mac on 2026-10-09. It starts at login, restarts itself if it crashes,
and runs the schedule and the dashboard together. Restart after changing agent code with
`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/in.alphanova.jarvis`; stop it with
`launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/in.alphanova.jarvis`. Logs: `~/.alphanova/logs/`. The plist hardcodes this checkout's path and
`/Users/sarda/.local/bin/node`; edit both if either moves.

## Layout

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `runtime.mjs` | the daemon — tick loop, dispatch, budget governor, signal handling |
| `scheduler.mjs` | `schedule.json` → due tasks, with guards |
| `schedule.json` | the cron table (§4.2). Data, not code |
| `cron.mjs` | 5-field cron matcher, evaluated in IST. No dependency |
| `envelope.mjs` | signal + task validation. **Where the two invariants live** |
| `bus.mjs` | append-only JSONL log + SQLite index, subscribe/emit |
| `memory.mjs` | SQLite: signals, subjects, outcomes, preferences, runs |
| `registry.mjs` | agent registration and the tool allowlist boundary |
| `config.mjs` | paths, IST helpers, Keychain access |
| `ulid.mjs` | sortable ids |
| `cli.mjs` | inspection commands |
| `server.mjs` | the dashboard server — loopback only, serves `public/` and the JSON API |
| `public/index.html` | the dashboard: one self-contained page, no build, no CDN |
| `market.mjs` | the agents' only data tool — a client over a market API |
| `materiality.mjs` | the 3-condition gate (§6.3). **No model calls** |
| `brief.mjs` | folds the bus into the three daily briefs (§4.5) |
| `agents/macro.mjs` | agent 1 — market research & news |
| `agents/jarvis-self.mjs` | brief composition and retention |
| `agents/index.mjs` | registration — one line per agent |

## The materiality gate

`materiality.mjs` is the reason the macro agent cannot invent a narrative. A headline
becomes material only when all three hold:

1. **move** — the lead instrument moved ≥1.5σ of its own trailing 20-session daily return
2. **publishers** — ≥2 distinct outlets carried the theme in the last 6 hours
3. **coherence** — a *strict* majority of the theme's linked instruments moved the way
   that theme's correlation structure predicts

Nothing in it calls a model; the model (later) only phrases what the arithmetic found,
and may only restate numbers already present in `evidence[]`. Failing any condition is
not an error — it is a `routine` signal. Most hours of most days are routine, and a
system that cannot say so is not measuring anything.

Observed live on 2026-09-30: 16 publishers were running Strait-of-Hormuz stories,
including a naval-mine discovery, while Brent moved +0.09% (+0.03σ). The gate held it at
`routine`. That is the whole point.

Macro observations top out at `elevated`. `urgent` is reserved for position risk and
capped at 3/day (§4.4) — spending that budget on a commodity move would defeat the cap.

Themes live in `api/market.js` (`THEMES`) so the endpoint and the agent cannot drift
apart, and a test asserts every theme instrument exists in the terminal's directory.

## The two invariants

Both are enforced in `envelope.mjs`, on the write path, so no agent can route around
them by "writing to the bus directly":

1. **`evidence[]` must be non-empty.** A signal an agent cannot substantiate is
   rejected. This is the defence against a model narrating a market story with no data
   behind it, and it mirrors the terminal's existing stance that unavailable data stays
   unavailable.
2. **`action.requiresApproval` is forced `true`** for `options_strategy`,
   `equity_order`, `send_email`, `booking` and `payment` — overwriting whatever the
   agent set. An agent cannot opt itself out.

`registry.mjs` adds the third boundary: an agent declaring a tool outside its allowlist,
or any tool in `FORBIDDEN` (order placement, mail send, payment), fails to register at
all. Containment is a startup error, not a runtime hope.

## Storage

Everything lives under `~/.alphanova/` (override with `JARVIS_HOME`):

```
jarvis.db              SQLite query index — rebuildable
signals/2026-09-30.jsonl   durable append-only log — the source of truth
logs/jarvis-2026-09-30.jsonl
briefs/
```

The JSONL log is authoritative. A lost or corrupted database is recoverable:

```bash
rm ~/.alphanova/jarvis.db*
npm run jarvis -- reindex
```

## Secrets

Never in `.env.local` — that file sits in `~/Downloads` and gets copied around. The
daemon reads from the Keychain:

```bash
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s jarvis.kite.token -w
security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s jarvis.anthropic.key -w
```

`config.mjs: secret(name)` returns `null` when a secret is absent rather than throwing,
so a missing credential shows up as one degraded agent instead of a dead daemon.

## Tests

```bash
npm test          # 161 tests
```

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tests/jarvis-envelope.test.js` | the two envelope invariants, ULID ordering |
| `tests/jarvis-bus.test.js` | bus, memory, correlation primitives, retention |
| `tests/jarvis-schedule.test.js` | cron/IST correctness, guards, registry containment, budget governor |
| `tests/jarvis-macro.test.js` | the materiality gate, theme config, brief composition |
| `tests/jarvis-server.test.js` | dashboard API, approvals, loopback guard, path traversal, CSP |

`npm test` points `JARVIS_HOME` at a temp directory, so running the suite never touches
the real store.

## Next

Phase 4 is the `momentum` agent. Adding an agent is unchanged from the contract phase 1
fixed: register into `Registry` with a `tools` allowlist, and return
`{signals, tokens, toolCalls}` from each intent handler. `agents/macro.mjs` is the
worked example, and a new agent appears on the dashboard with no UI work.
